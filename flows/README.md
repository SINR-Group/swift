This is the code for testing part of our CVPR code and further.

To run the code, you need to install ffmpeg and opencv 2.4.11.

We have attached a modified version of ffmpeg 2.7.2 on the code package.

To install ffmpeg and opencv. We follow the guide on http://www.ozbotz.org/opencv-installation/ . But you need to install ffmpeg of our version and opencv 2.4.11 instead.

- For extracting Motion Vector image, you can run the extract_mvs_sample.sh. The code is designed for the videos with resolution of 320 * 240 (width * height). If you need to extract motion vector from different resolution, you can modified **line 55-56 of draw_flow.cpp from MV-code-release folder** to the desired resolution.


    **Note** The time reported in the paper is calculated without I/O, which means without the time of writing dump file and images to disk.

- The MV-code-release folder is created using eclipse.

The model of UCF-101 is released (both spatial part and motion vector part).
1. Motion vector model and Spatial Model for UCF-101 split1, split2, and split3 can be found on: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RXXAauI_inR1KvO8ygQmeNBBKRbj3xDJ?usp=sharing

2. The images of motion vector extracted from UCF-101 can be found on: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MKy7uDzXCF0Q-ZIkABpaPYIjHbVHDBwx
