Swift: Adaptive Video Streaming with Layered Neural Codecs
==========================================================

The repo contains source code for the paper [Swift: Adaptive Video Streaming with Layered Neural Codecs]() [NSDI'2022]. It has three independent codebases: 1) Motion flow extracter, 2) Layered neural codec located in the codec folder, 3) Adaptive video streaming pipeline using the proposed layered neural codec, located in streamer folder.
